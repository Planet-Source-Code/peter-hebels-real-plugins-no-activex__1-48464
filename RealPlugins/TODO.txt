Thank you for downloading this code! This document tells you how to get the plugin example up and running.

I have included two plugin examples written in Visual C++, you can find them in the 'PLG_Divide' and
'PLG_multiply' folders. 
Before you use the plugin example written in Visual Basic, you first have to compile this plugins and put 
the compiled dll files in the same directory where the Visual Basic example lives.

Hope this plugin example is usefull to you!
